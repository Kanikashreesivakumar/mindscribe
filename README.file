Mindscribe – AI-Powered Thought-to-Text System
🚀 Mindscribe is an AI-powered web application that analyzes neural wave images and converts them into text-based thoughts. This project aims to help individuals with speech impairments or disabilities express their thoughts effortlessly.

🌟 Features
✅ Image-to-Thought AI – Upload a neural wave image & generate text.
✅ Emotion & Cognitive State Detection – AI predicts feelings & intentions.
✅ DeepSeek RI API Integration – Advanced AI processing for text output.
✅ Secure Authentication – Login/signup via Supabase Auth.
✅ Cloud Storage – Saves processed thoughts securely.
✅ Customizable UI – Dark/Light mode, font adjustments.

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend:
Next.js (React Framework)
Tailwind CSS + ShadCN (Modern UI components)
Supabase Auth (User authentication & database)
Backend:
Flask (Python-based backend)
Supabase DB (Database storage for thoughts)
DeepSeek RI API (AI processing for neural wave images)

📌 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1️⃣ User uploads an image of neural wave signals.
2️⃣ AI (DeepSeek RI API) processes the image and extracts cognitive insights.
3️⃣ Text output appears, displaying emotions, thoughts, or intentions.
4️⃣ Users can edit, save, or export the generated thoughts.

📌 Future Scope
🚀 Real EEG Hardware Support
🚀 More Advanced Thought Predictions
🚀 Integration with Assistive Technologies
